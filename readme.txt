Turbocharge your WordPress images by using an edge provider (like Cloudflare or Accelerated Domains) and optimizing your HTML markup.

== Description ==

Edge Images automatically uses your edge transformation service (e.g., Cloudflare, Accelerated Domains, Imgix, etc.) to apply performance optimizations to `<img>` markup.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This plugin requires a supported edge provider with image transformation features enabled (e.g., Cloudflare Pro, BunnyCDN, etc). See the Requirements section for details.

= üöÄ Why should I use Edge Images? =

* **Instant Performance Boost**: Automatically optimize and serve images in modern formats (WebP/AVIF) through your existing CDN
* **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with your existing images and themes
* **No Local Processing**: All transformations happen at the edge - no server load or storage overhead
* **Perfectly Sized Images**: Automatically generates the exact image dimensions needed for every device and viewport
* **Cost Effective**: No need for expensive image optimization services or additional storage

= üéØ Perfect For =

* Sites with lots of images that need optimization
* Performance-focused developers and site owners
* Anyone using Cloudflare, BunnyCDN, or similar services
* Sites that want modern image formats without the complexity
* Developers tired of managing multiple image sizes

= üí° How It Works =

WordPress typically creates multiple copies of each uploaded image in different sizes. This approach is inefficient and often results in:

* Images that are too large or small for their display size
* Unnecessary storage usage
* Missing sizes for modern responsive designs
* Lack of modern format support (WebP/AVIF)

Edge Images solves these problems by:

1. Intercepting image requests
2. Determining the optimal size and format needed
3. Using your CDN to transform the image on-demand
4. Caching the result for future requests

= ‚ö°Ô∏è Features =

**Core Features**

* Automatic WebP/AVIF conversion
* Intelligent responsive image handling
* Smart `srcset` generation
* Automatic image optimization
* Optional `<picture>` element wrapping
* Zero local processing
* Maintains original images

**Advanced Features**

* Fine-grained transformation control
* Multiple CDN provider support
* Developer-friendly filters
* Yoast SEO & Rank Math integrations
* Bricks integration
* Gutenberg compatibility

= üîå Supported Providers =

* **Cloudflare** (Pro plan or higher)
* **Accelerated Domains**
* **BunnyCDN**
* **Imgix**

= üõ†Ô∏è Technical Example =

**Your Code**

`
echo wp_get_attachment_image(1, [640,400], false, ['fit' => 'contain']);
`

**What WordPress Usually Outputs**

`
<img width="380" height="400" 
     src="/uploads/2024/11/1.jpg" 
     class="attachment-640x400 size-640x400 wp-image-123" 
     srcset="/uploads/2024/11/1.jpg 400w, /uploads/2024/11/1-285x300.jpg 285w" 
     sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px">
`

That's multiple different images files, none of which are the right size!

**What Edge Images Outputs**

`
<picture class="edge-images-container" style="--max-width: 640px;">
  <img 
       class="attachment-1140x600 size-640x400 wp-image-123 edge-images-processed"
       width="640" height="400" 
       src="/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,fit=contain,w=640,h=400/uploads/2024/11/1.jpg" 
       srcset="/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,w=320,h=188/uploads/2024/11/1.jpg 320w,
               /cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,w=640,h=400/uploads/2024/11/1.jpg 640w,
               /cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,w=1280,h=800/uploads/2024/11/1.jpg 1280w"
       sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px">
</picture>
`

That's a range of perfectly sized options for different devices and viewports, automatically optimized images in modern formats, served from your CDN, futureproofed for supporting next-generation capabilities, and with no storage overheads.

= üé® Customization =

**Transform Parameters**
Control every aspect of image transformation with attributes like:
* `width`/`height`: Exact dimensions
* `fit`: Resizing behavior (contain, cover, crop)
* `quality`: Compression level
* `format`: Output format (auto, webp, avif)

**Filtering**
Disable transformations globally or selectively:

`
// Disable all transformations
add_filter('edge_images_disable', '__return_true');

// Disable for specific images
add_filter('edge_images_disable_transform', function($should_disable, $html) {
    if (strpos($html, 'example.jpg') !== false) {
        return true;
    }
    return $should_disable;
}, 10, 2);

// Override max width for constrained content
add_filter('edge_images_max_width', function($max_width) {
    // Example: Use a different max width for single posts
    if (is_single()) {
        return 800;
    }
    return $max_width;
});

// Customize srcset width multipliers
add_filter('edge_images_width_multipliers', function($multipliers) {
    // Add more granular steps between sizes
    return [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2];
});
`
